# OS_Simulator
Reads through a configuration and metadata file, and simulates a running operating system with various commands


This is a simulated operating system. Cleanly organized/commented code that demonstrates multiple operating system practices such as; dynamic memory allocation, threading, flow control, control block organization, and error control. This code pulls input from our configurations and our meta data. We take the data and depending on the configurations and various commands, and react accordingly while maintaining a properly expected output. There is much more that you can see that I explored with this project, so please feel free to reach out to me if you are more interesting in some of the specifics of proper operation.
